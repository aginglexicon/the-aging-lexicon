The following resources were compiled by participants of the [Symposium on the Aging Lexicon](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/fakultaet/abteilungen/cognitive-and-decision-sciences/the-aging-lexicon/) that took place in Basel, June 7-9, 2018. 

The listing of resources aims to help future efforts to understand adult age differences in the development of lexical and semantic knowledge.
